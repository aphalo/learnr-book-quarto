# The book in a nutshell

The *second edition* (yellow-red wordcloud cover) of my book *Learn R:
As a Language* has publication date 26 April 2024. The [R package
'learnrbook](https://cran.r-project.org/package=learnrbook)' available
through CRAN contains data and the R code from scripts and chunks in the
book. Package 'learnrboo' versions \>= 2.0.0 support both book editions
of the book. I typeset the book using $\LaTeX$ and R package 'knitr'.
The 2nd edition includes many new diagrams and flowcharts that help
explain the structure of R code, the structure of R objects, and the
control of execution constructs.

The book is published as paperback and hardback printed books and as an
eBook. The page count has increased from 364 to 466, and the number of
colour illustrations from 114 to 191. The price increase of the
paperback is minimal, from 58.99 to 59.99 pounds. The hardback of the
2nd edition at 150 pounds is 5 pounds cheaper than the first edition.
The 2nd edition of the book is available from [the publisher through the book's web
page](https://www.routledge.com/Learn-R-As-a-Language/Aphalo/p/book/9781032516998)
at a 20% discount until 31 July 2024 when using the discount code below.

The book is also available at brick and mortar booksellers and through
web stores, at prices that may differ from the publisher's prices.

# News

**\[April 2024\]** Second edition published. The price of the eBook is
the same as for the paperback. Until 31 July there is a 20% discount
available to all at the [the publisher through the book's web
page](https://www.routledge.com/Learn-R-As-a-Language/Aphalo/p/book/9781032516998).
Supplementary material is now available as web pages at the [my website](https://www.r4photobiology.info/) with some of the most relevant pages
highlighted at the [R index page of the site](https://www.r4photobiology.info/r-index.html).

**\[September 2021\]** I have made available through this website
[supplementary chapters for the
book](https://www.learnr-book.info/learn-r-extra-web.pdf) (over 100
pages). These are typeset using the same design as the book itself and
numbering of chapters and pages continues from where they end in the
book. These chapters are still work in progress. After further revision
I intend to add the code they contain also to package 'learnrbook'. They
are released under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence.

**\[July 2021\]** Only two small changes to the code chunks are needed
to avoid deprecation messages from 'tidyverse' packages. The
['learnrbook' package](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/learnrbook/)
(1.0.2) adds the **R** code for all code chunks in the book as
executable and editable `.R` files. Additional material related to my
'ggplot2' extensions is available in the vignettes of my packages
['gginnards'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/gginnards/),
['ggpp'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpp/) and
['ggpmisc'](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpmisc/), all available
through CRAN.
